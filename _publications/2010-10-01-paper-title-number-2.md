excerpt: 'This study developed a biophysical and economic model to evaluate how irrigation water salinity affects crop yield and profitability for key crops in Californiaâ€™s Central Valley. Results showed that increased salinity and low irrigation rates significantly reduced yields and profits, highlighting the importance of site-specific irrigation management for sustainable agriculture.'
