title: "Effect of surfactant surface and interfacial tension reduction on infiltration into hydrophobic porous media"
collection: publications
category:   Article    
permalink: /publication/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706123004123
excerpt: 'The study found that treating hydrophobic soil with surfactants before adding water improves infiltration more than applying surfactant in the water itself. This is because pre-treatment allows more surfactant to bind to the soil surface, reducing interfacial tension and helping water move through the soil more effectively.'
